<h1>Explore Network Vulnerabilities using Nmap</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of methods of scanning the entire network, hack targets and find the operating systems thye are running as well as what ports they have open and discover vulnerabilities that can be further on exploited. This project will be developed using Nmap.

<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Nmap</b>
- <b>Kali</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Check for live systems: <br/>
  
  - <b>For this project we will be executing those tests on my own network</b>
  - <b>Executing a live scan will display a list of what's alive on my network subnet</b>

<br />
Check for open ports: <br/>
  
  - <b>After we found out which IP addresses are active, we can start searching for the ports that those hosts are listening on</b>
  - <b>If our goal would've been to hack websites then we will be searching for the http and https ports ( 80 and 443) if they are open</b>
  - <b>The switch -sT is a type of port scan called TCP connect or full open scan (meaning that it uses the 3 way handshake because of the TCP)</b>

<br />
Stealth mode: <br/>
  
  - <b>Because of IDS that is usually built into firewalls might detect this nmap operation and might try to stop you from tracking</b>
  - <b>However, there is a possibility of bypassing this security measure and that is of using -sS instead of -sT</b>
  - <b>One way of remembering this is that S stands for Stealthy, meaning that it will perform a SYN Scan also known as half open scan, where -sT was a full open scan</b>
  - <b>Half open scan means that the full TCP connection is not going to be established, hoping to bypass the firewall (which usually reacts when dishonest traits are discovered with full 3 way handshake connections)</b>

<br />
<br />
Default scan: <br/>
  
  - <b>Default scans happens when no port is mentioned when running nmap command</b>
  - <b>This will include the top 1000 ports or the most popular ports </b>

Analysing using Wireshark: <br/>
  
  - <b>We will be filetering by IP address</b>

<br />
    
  - <b>Here we will be making additional filtering, where we will display the communications between the nmap and target, on the TCP port 80</b>
  - <b>Even though on our results we noticed that none of the ports are listening (all ports are closed), this can be noticed in the wireshark as well</b>
  - <b>On the seconds line we can notice that a SYN packet has been sent meaning that is trying to establish a connection, although no SYN, ACK packet is sent back meaning that the server didn't respond back, so no connection has been created</b>
  - <b>Because there was no response back to the client from the server side, the connection has ended, this can be deduced from the RST, ACK packet, where RST stands for reset, or ending the conversarion on a TCP</b>

<br />
Detect the OS: <br/>
  
  - <b>Here we made use of the -O to display the operating system of the selected IP address, in this case my IP address</b>

<br />
<br />
Agressive mode search: <br/>
  
  - <b>This mode will do an OS detection, check for the versions of the protocols as well as script scanning and traceroute </b>
  - <b>As we only have the ssh port open for listening, we can see the version of the ssh port</b>

<br />
  
  - <b>In the picture bellow we can see the traceroute which stands for how far away we are from the selected ip</b>

<br />
Using decoy: <br/>
  
  - <b>The reason why is safer to use a decoy is because you don't want to expose yourself while you are scanning a network </b>
  - <b>The way it behaves is by covering your tracks and makes sure that no one can trace the traffic that you are producing while you are scanning a network back to you</b>
  - <b>The command -D stands for decoy and it will work by deploying 1 or more randomly selected IP's and make it look like the traffic comes from more hosts rather than just 1 (our machine)</b>
  - <b>Another way of avoiding being detected is by lowering the speed of the scanning process where -T0 and -T1 the slowest, and -T4 is the fastest, and -T2 and -T3 are the normal speed (athough the first one is serial and the latests is paralel) </b>
