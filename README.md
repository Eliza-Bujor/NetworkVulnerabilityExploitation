<h1>Explore Network Vulnerabilities using Nmap</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of methods of scanning the entire network, hack targets and find the operating systems thye are running as well as what ports they have open and discover vulnerabilities that can be further on exploited. This project will be developed using Nmap.

<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Nmap</b>
- <b>Kali</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Check for live systems: <br/>
  
  - <b>For this project we will be executing those tests on my own network</b>
  - <b>Executing a live scan will display a list of what's alive on my network subnet</b>

<br />
Check for open ports: <br/>
  
  - <b>After we found out which IP addresses are active, we can start searching for the ports that those hosts are listening on</b>
  - <b>If our goal would've been to hack websites then we will be searching for the http and https ports ( 80 and 443) if they are open</b>
  - <b>The switch -sT is a type of port scan called TCP connect or full open scan (meaning that it uses the 3 way handshake because of the TCP)</b>

<br />
Stealth mode: <br/>
  
  - <b>Because of IDS that is usually built into firewalls might detect this nmap operation and might try to stop you from tracking</b>
  - <b>However, there is a possibility of bypassing this security measure and that is of using -sS instead of -sT</b>
  - <b>One way of remembering this is that S stands for Stealthy, meaning that it will perform a SYN Scan also known as half open scan, where -sT was a full open scan</b>
  - <b>Half open scan means that the full TCP connection is not going to be established, hoping to bypass the firewall (which usually reacts when dishonest traits are discovered with full 3 way handshake connections)</b>

<br />
Default scan: <br/>
  
  - <b>Default scans happens when no port is mentioned when running nmap command</b>
  - <b>This will include the top 1000 ports or the most popular ports </b>
